## Development

Install node and npm (in whatever way works for your system)

Get the dependencies: `npm install`

Compile and start the watch process: `grunt browserify`

Serve dist/test.html via HTTP, and access it from your browser. 

You can do this by installing and running http-server

`npm install http-server -g`

Then, in the dist directory, 

`http-server`

Open the browser in `http://127.0.0.1:8080/test.html`
