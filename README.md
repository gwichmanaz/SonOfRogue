## Development

Install node and npm (in whatever way works for your system)

Get the dependencies: `npm install`

Start the build process: `grunt build`

Serve dist/test.html via HTTP, and access it from your browser. 

You can do this by installing and running http-server: `npm install http-server -g`

Then, in the dist directory, run `http-server`

Then open the browser in `http://127.0.0.1:8080/test.html`
